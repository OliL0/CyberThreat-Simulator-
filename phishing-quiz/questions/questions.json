First its the email address as it is not from a legitimate google source as seen from the spelling which reply is misspelled as reeply. Secondly the urgency in the title and content of the message which is a simple tactic that is used by attackers to try make the user act quickly seeing their account is at risk. Lastly the link is not a legitimate link and is trying to mimic a real google link with parts altered like ending with .uk and not .com"
